# 🎮 FIRST TIME USER FLOW - TOÀN DÂN TU TIÊN

## 🌟 TỔNG QUAN

Hệ thống First Time User Flow được thiết kế để tạo trải nghiệm onboarding tuyệt vời cho người chơi mới. Khi user lần đầu đăng nhập và chưa có nhân vật nào, họ sẽ được xem story intro trước khi tạo nhân vật.

## 🔄 USER FLOW LOGIC

### 1. Authentication Check
```
User visits /characters
↓
Check if user is logged in
├─ Not logged in → Redirect to /auth/login
└─ Logged in → Continue to step 2
```

### 2. Character Existence Check
```
Check if user has existing characters
├─ Has characters → Show character list (existing user)
└─ No characters → Show story intro (first time user)
```

### 3. First Time User Experience
```
Story Intro
├─ User watches complete story → Character Creation
├─ User skips story → Character Creation
└─ Character Creation → Character List
```

### 4. Existing User Experience
```
Character List
├─ Create new character → Story + Character Creation
├─ Select character → Enter game
├─ Delete character → Update list
└─ View story again → Story Intro (optional)
```
